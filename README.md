# I inluded several notebooks because this was a tough week for me.  I did not get to work on solely one machine - there was much time in the office;
# Especially this past weekend Aug 28-30 due to emergent planning for Lake Charles damange restoration.  
# I transfered notebooks back and forth so that I could tinker on the homework over breaks.
# My FINAL file is HerosOfPimoli_starter2 (1) FINAL


## THREE TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS DATA(this is also included in the comments of my FINAL document. 
# 1) Male dominated industry/game. Escpecially when looking at total dollars, they provided all but $400 of the income.
# 2) However, women spend more $ per transaction, so if we could gain more female base, revenue would increase at a quicker pace.
# 3) There is a normal distribution that peaks in the 20-24 age range; so keeping that audience pleased is key to revenues.
